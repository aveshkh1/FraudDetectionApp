# Fraud Detection Web Application

## Description
This is a web application for detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning. The model is based on CatBoost, a gradient boosting algorithm, and aims to identify suspicious or fraudulent transactions from a given dataset.

The web app allows users to input transaction details, and the model predicts whether the transaction is fraudulent or not. A simple interface allows users to input various features like transaction type, amount, old balances, and more.

## Features
- Predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.
- Web interface for easy interaction.
- Uses CatBoost model for fraud detection.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: A Python web framework for building the web app.
- **CatBoost**: A powerful gradient boosting library for machine learning, used to train the fraud detection model.
- **HTML**: For building the frontend interface.
- **Python**: The main language for building the app and handling the model.
- **Jinja2**: For rendering dynamic content on the web page.
